# SPAM Detection


A spam detector using NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a machine learning model that analyzes text messages to identify and filter out unwanted or unsolicited content, commonly found in emails or short messages. It leverages NLP techniques to detect patterns and features in text data, enabling it to distinguish between legitimate and spam messages based on factors such as keywords, context, and linguistic analysis. This technology is essential for maintaining communication channels free from unwanted or harmful content, enhancing user experience, and protecting against phishing and fraud.
